  <H2>Description</H2>
  <p>Just about every argument imaginable has been made on the categorization of the hot dog. The history of the hot dog reveals a different answer, though.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Large saucepan</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Hot dogs</li>
    <li>Tongs</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Fill a large saucepan with enough water to cover hot dogs (about 1 cup per hot dog).
</li>
  <li>Bring water to a boil.</li>
  <li>Add the hot dogs one at a time using tongs.</li>
  <li>Reduce the heat to the low setting and allow the hot dogs to simmer for anywhere from 3 to 6 minutes (the longer they simmer, the crispier they'll be).</li>
  <li>Once they're done, use tongs to remove them from the water and pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
